## About Me

I am a research assistant who previously interned at the Indian Institute of Science [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/), working on Neural Machine Translation for low-resource languages under [Dr. Prathosh AP](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/prathosh-a-p/). I also interned at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay [IIT-B](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), under [Dr. Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/). I did my undergrad in Electrical and Electronics from Bangalore Institute of Technology.
